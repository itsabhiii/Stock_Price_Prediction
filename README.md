Model can be mainly helpful for the analysis of the data and than trying to predict the possible closing price of the particular stock.
In more over scenario and based on my personal fedback the model can be really helpful to have some idea for the weekly possible closing data prediction specificly for NIFTY50 and BANKNIFTY indices.

The model trying to analyse the behaviour of data and can be work for intra-day player as well!
